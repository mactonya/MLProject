# Description of this porject

The idea is simple enough: In midterm project, we design (or recreate a/an existing) game and a simple AI, and in final project, we will try to improve AI (Teach AI how to play that game and optimize the result).

We will pick the game **"本草"** (Herbalism) as our midterm project. For the detailed rules, please refer to the following link:

# How to play

Clone the project and execute `python main.py` in the downloaded folder.

# Final Project

**This is a solo project.**
